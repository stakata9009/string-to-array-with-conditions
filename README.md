# string-to-array-with-conditions
Convert a string into array without including spaces and numbers larger than 5

This program has the ability to take a user input and follow two conditions:
  1. Ignore every interval (space bar);
  2. Ignore numbers larger than 5;

While following these two conditions, the program is able to determine the length of the array and successfully insert every symbol into the array.
